# CSV Database

## Objective
In this lab, we will work with data manipulation. This is a handy skill to have when reading from and writing to CSV files.

## Task 1
Finish the functions located in index.js to make the tests pass. Practice modularity and seperation of concerns.
Add more tests on the way to test each step.

## Task 2
If you complete Task 1, apply these functions in order to create a local database with a CSV file. In the database, you should be able to:
  - Read from the file.
  - Write to the file to update and/or add new heroes. (A tip is to always send the whole string of hereos and update the entire file.)
  
For this task, we have provided you with a starter file: heroDB.csv.
